### Project Overview

Welcome to Aliens Among U.S., our UFO Sightings Analysis Project. Our mission is to explore, analyze, and visualize reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from around the world. Using advanced statistical statistical techniques and R programming, we delve into decades of sighting reports to uncover patterns and insights.

### Our Goals

1. **Data Collection**: Compile a comprehensive dataset of UFO sightings from various sources.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Utilize R to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

3. **Analysis**: Analyze the data to identify trends, hotspots, and temporal patterns in UFO sightings.

4. **Visualization**: Create interactive visualizations to present our findings in an accessible and engaging manner.

### Methodology

Our approach combines descriptive statistics, geospatial analysis, and time series analysis. We use R packages, including `tidyverse` for data manipulation, `ggplot2` and `plotly` for visualization, and `leaflet` for interactive mapping.

### Interesting Findings

- **Hotspots of Activity**: Our analysis has identified several regions with unusually high numbers of sightings.
- **Temporal Trends**: We've observed significant increases in sightings around specific dates and events.
- **Common characteristics**: Analysis of descriptions and reports has revealed common features in many sightings.

### Data Visualization

Here are some of our key visualizations:

- **Interactive Map of Sightings**: Explore the global distribution of UFO sightings.
- **Time Series Analysis**: See how sightings have evolved over time.
- **Categorical Analysis**: Understand the common characteristics of UFO reports.

### The Team

This project is a collaborative effort of first-year M.S. biostatistics students at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.
