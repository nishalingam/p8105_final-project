Sightings</h1>

</div>


<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Our project explores the reporting of unidentified flying objects
(UFOs) throughout the U.S. UFOs, by their very nature, leave unanswered
questions, some of which we hope to explore through this project. With
the wealth of information gathered about these phenomena and motivated
by the <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/26/politics/ufo-house-hearing-congress/index.html">congressional
hearings</a> <a
href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/analysis-whistleblower-testimonies-did-not-change-our-basic-understanding-of-ufos">earlier
this year</a>, we wanted to create a resource to understand the data on
UFO encounters. Our project addresses three key components to provide
this understanding: when the encounters happened, where the encounters
happened, and what was encountered.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related Work</h2>
<p>Inspired by<a href="https://nuforc.org/">National UFO Reporting
Center</a>, researches such as <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-01746-3">Faculty
perceptions of unidentified aerial phenomena</a>, <a
href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S2251171723400068">The
Scientific Investigation of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) Using
Multimodal Ground-Based Observatories</a>, our project seeks to expand
on existing research using advanced statistical methods and R
programming.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial Questions</h2>
<p>We started with key questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What are the hotspots for UFO sightings?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the common characteristics of UFO sightings?</p></li>
<li><p>How have reports of UFO sightings changed over time?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there common features in these reports that can be
quantitatively analyzed?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As our project progressed, we began to explore more nuanced
questions.</p>
</div>
<div id="evolution-of-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Evolution of Questions:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Do certain geographical areas have higher frequencies of certain
types of UFO sightings?</p></li>
<li><p>Has the nature of UFO sightings changed over time? For example, a
follow-up to temporal pattern analysis, looking at changes in
characteristics (shapes) of sightings across different decades.</p></li>
<li><p>Are there correlations between UFO sightings and other
variables?</p></li>
<li><p>Will mentioning certain words in the report affect the duration
of sightings or other variables?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>Our primary work was on data collected by the National UFO Reporting
Center (NUFORC). <a href="https://data.world/timothyrenner">Timothy
Renner</a> pulled and hosted the data version we used separately. We
restricted our analysis to UFO reports made within the U.S.A. and
removed reports that contained inconsistent locations (some reported
U.S. but showed longitudes and latitudes in South America, Europe, or
Canada) or were missing fundamental values. This left us with 100,820
reports from an initial set of 141,261 reports.</p>
<p>The duration of the UFO encounter was reported in the text and had
inconsistent formatting, as well as unexpected special characters, e.g.,
“~8 minutes,” “30 SECS,” or “3 hours or more.”. We wrote a function to
identify numeric time values within these strings and the appropriate
time units (seconds, minutes, and hours) and convert these reports to
numbers of seconds. While this approach wasn’t perfect, it allowed us to
perform subsequent analyses on most of the data.</p>
<p>We incorporated data from a few additional sources as well. To locate
cities that were near the location of UFO reports, we utilized a U.S.
city dataset from <a href="https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities">simple
maps</a>. We used decennial census data from the <a
href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/">U.S.
Census Bureau</a> to control for differing populations across states. We
also incorporated basic information about U.S. geography from R and the
<a href="https://geojson.org/">GeoJSON dataset</a>.</p>
<p>We also created new variables using packages such as stringr and
spacyr. The spacyr package helps to dissect long comments into words.
These words are automatically processed into their root word, or lemma,
and are tagged by their parts of speech. Due to the size of the dataset,
only 5000 random samples are used in the dataset. We created two other
variables: color, which extracts the first appearance of color given by
the report, and adj, which records the appearance of the top 20
adjectives in the comments in binary form. The color analysis uses
keywords generated from R’s built-in function color(), and the adjective
analysis uses keywords by filtering the top 20 from the spacyr data
frame.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>
<p>Our exploratory analysis included the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Temporal Analysis:</li>
</ol>
<p>The frequency of sightings over time (years, months, hours of the
day, weekdays) is of main concern in temporal analysis. We mainly use
line charts to visualize the aggregate trends of each state over time
and then use smooth lines to estimate the average sighting trend in the
US.</p>
<p><strong>Trend and Adjusted Trend Over Years by States: </strong>
Following 1995, there was a significant increase in UFO sightings,
possibly due to the internet’s quick development. Most states saw a peak
in sightings around 2014, then a decline. Nearly all states experienced
sharp declines in sightings in 2018, and then there was an increase in
2019 and 2020. UFO sightings within individual states varied
significantly from year to year, with some states showing sharp
increases or decreases. The number of UFO reports in California
consistently outnumbered those in other states, possibly due to
population effects.</p>
<p>After adjusting for population, the overall trend mirrored the
aggregate sighting trend, with a rapid increase post-1995 and a peak
around 2014. Vermont consistently had the highest sightings per 1
million population, indicating a potential hotspot.</p>
<p><strong>Trend and Adjusted Trend Over Months by States: </strong>
Sightings showed seasonal variations, with summer having the highest
reported sightings in most states. Some states, such as Florida,
experienced peak sightings in December, indicating regional variations.
Washington State showed a unique rapid increase starting in May and a
sharp decrease after July.</p>
<p>Adjusting for population had a minimal impact on the trend over the
past few months. However, Alaska showed a unique trend with the highest
sightings per 1 million in winter, potentially related to polar
night.</p>
<p><strong>Trend Over Hours by States: </strong> UFO sightings were more
commonly reported during the evening hours, peaking around 21:00.
Sightings during daytime hours, particularly from 6:00 to 15:00, were
relatively low.</p>
<p><strong>Trend Over Weekdays by States:</strong> The average sightings
increased gradually from Monday to Saturday, peaking on Saturday, then
decreasing on Sunday. California showed a decline from Sunday to Monday,
with an increase during the weekdays and a peak on Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>Trend Over Time by UFO Shapes:</strong> Light, circles, and
triangles were the most observed UFO shapes, following a similar trend
of rapid increase, peaking around 2014, decline in 2018, and another
peak in 2020. Fireball had a peak before 2000, while disk sightings
showed a steady increase in the 1970s.</p>
<p><strong>Adjectives Used in The Report Before and After 2000:</strong>
Adjectives used before 2000 exhibit greater diversity and complexity,
featuring descriptors like “approximate,” “entire,” “exact,” “round,”
“huge,” and “slow.” In contrast, post-2000 adjectives tend to be brief,
including terms such as “clear,” “slow,” and “big.” The prevalence of
contemporary words like “anonymous” in post-2000 data may be attributed
to the surge in UFO reports with the rise of internet usage. The
difference in average education levels between those reporting before
and after 2000, as well as the recent increase in photographic
information availability, may also have an impact on this shift.
Additionally, post-2000 messages tend to be more concise and direct,
possibly to expedite information dissemination.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Text Analysis</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Top Nouns:</strong> These words primarily identify elements
related to UFO sightings. They encompass the UFO itself (light, object),
the setting (sky, night, minute, second), and items used to distinguish
UFOs from conventional objects (star, plane, craft).</p>
<p><strong>Top Verbs:</strong> These verbs describe the actions and
reactions of both observers and the UFO. They encapsulate observations
(see, look, watch), movement (move, fly), and perceptions (appear,
disappear).</p>
<p><strong>Top Adjectives:</strong> These words are descriptive but
don’t fall strictly into noun or verb categories. They are being
analyzed for potential correlations with UFO sighting duration. They
include descriptors like brightness (bright, high, large), colors (red,
white, blue, orange, green, dark), quantity (few, many), clarity (clear,
visible), and peculiarity (strange, different).</p>

<li>Correlation &amp; Regression Analysis:</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<p>Our initial goal was to locate areas where UFO reports were common.
According to the data, sightings occur more frequently in remote
locations and crowded urban areas. This implies that the more possible
observers there are, the more likely it is that sighting reports will
occur. But it also suggests that some geographical characteristics or
other unidentified factors can contribute to the frequency of UFO
encounters.</p>
<p>Regarding the typical features of UFO reports, our research showed
various observed forms and actions. But reports of “lights,” “circles,”
and “discs” were standard, and they fit with the traditional UFO imagery
that has been widely accepted in the media and popular culture.</p>
<p>When exploring how reports of UFO sightings have changed over time,
we conducted a temporal analysis that showed a noticeable increase in
reported sightings during the late 20th century, which could be
correlated with the rise in science fiction media during that time.</p>
<p>According to our analysis, the majority of states saw a surge in UFO
encounters around 2014. There are multiple possible explanations for
this peak. Increased public interest in significant celestial events,
the availability of more digital recording equipment, and the widespread
use of drones may have led to more sightings and reports. Social media’s
ability to spread information quickly contributed to this increase as
well since sites like Facebook and Twitter have grown widely used and
made it possible for sightings to be reported promptly.</p>
<p>What’s interesting about 2018 is how few sightings there were. It
also corresponds with when drone technology became much more accessible
to the general public. This may have contributed to initial bewilderment
but ultimately improved public awareness of these objects and reduced
the number of UFO reports. Furthermore, modifications to the reporting
and data collection regulations might have affected the quantity of
reported sightings. One possible explanation for this reduction could
have been a modification to the reporting guidelines of the National UFO
Reporting Center.</p>
<p>The upsurge of sightings in 2019 and 2020 may be attributed to
various environmental and socio-cultural variables. Global lockdowns
resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, which started at the end of 2019
and continued throughout 2020. People may have spent extra time at home
due to the lockdowns, taking a closer look at the sky and witnessing
things they might not have noticed. Additionally, the Pentagon’s UFO
movies may have sparked the public’s renewed interest in aerial
phenomena, which may have led to an increase in the number of sightings
reported.</p>
<p>Seasonal fluctuations with summer highs may be linked to greater
outside activities and brighter skies, which raises the possibility of
seeing strange events. Local events, weather patterns, or tourists may
have an impact on regional variances, such as Florida’s peak in
December. The distinct atmospheric conditions during the polar night may
be responsible for Alaska’s winter peak, increasing the visibility or
prevalence of certain aerial phenomena.</p>
<p>A number of reasons could account for the rise in reports in the
evenings: more people are at home to watch the sky, lights in the sky
become more visible as night falls, and the usage of recreational drugs
during these hours may affect people’s propensity to report sightings.
The decreased number of sightings during the day may mean that UFOs are
less noticeable in the daylight or maybe because witnesses are too busy
during the day to detect or report strange objects.</p>
<p>The steady rise in sightings before Saturday may indicate that
people’s capacity and propensity to record sightings are influenced by
their free time. It’s possible that people were getting ready for the
upcoming workweek and spending less time gazing up at the sky on Sunday.
California’s distinct weekly pattern might be a reflection of social or
cultural norms peculiar to the state, such as weekly celebrations that
encourage individuals to gaze upward more frequently.</p>
<p>Most sightings were short—often lasting less than two
minutes—according to the recorded and categorized sighting durations,
which contribute to the quantitative aspects of the reports. This
numerical component gives the typically subjective nature of UFO
sighting accounts a veneer of objectivity.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the abundance of lights, triangles, and circles
represents common shapes of aerial vehicles or other objects that the
general public is unlikely to recognize. Additionally, these shapes are
frequently shown in media depictions of UFOs, which may sway people’s
accounts. The unusual trend of fireballs and disks may have been caused
by particular UFO events or by cultural factors prevalent at the time
that made certain shapes more “popular” or easily identifiable as
UFOs.</p>
<p>Pre-2000 reports were more descriptive in language. However, reports
written after 2000 were more concise. This difference in language use
may be attributed to the evolving nature of communication in the digital
age, where brevity is frequently rewarded for speedy information
transmission. The term “anonymous” appears in reports from after 2000,
which may point to a rise in people’s desire for anonymity or privacy in
the digital age. The change in terminology may also indicate shifts in
the demographics of those reporting sightings of UFOs, as descriptions
of sightings may differ depending on one’s educational background or
level of technological comfort.</p>
<p>Terminologies such as “clear,” “large,” and “high” in reports imply
that observers may accurately recognize certain traits even in
situations where the interaction is brief. These terms convey a degree
of confidence to the observer. Less striking hues like “dark” and
“green” may only be observed in a transient sighting and thus not be as
noticeable as others. The fact that observers have little time to
comprehend and remember what happened may be the reason for the vague
adjectives they employ; instead, they may choose to use more general
descriptors that are less precise but still capture the main ideas of
what they saw.</p>
<p>The observer may have preferred to use more specific terms like
“first,” “second,” “close,” and “bright” since they had more time to
examine the object closely and pick up on more subtle aspects. Upon
closer examination, terms like “small” and “strange” may surface,
enabling a comparison of the UFO’s characteristics with those of the
surrounding area. Easy-to-identify colors like “orange,” “red,” “white,”
and “blue” are reported, which implies that prolonged sightings provide
witnesses with sufficient opportunity to see more vibrant colors that
they might otherwise miss during a brief encounter.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations:</h2>
<p>Data Quality and Completeness:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The statistics on UFO sightings can be improved by complete
reporting. It’s possible that witnesses won’t report every sighting or
that their descriptions need to be revised.</p></li>
<li><p>The analysis may be skewed by errors in the reported data, such
as misspelled dates, times, places, or durations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Subjectivity in Sightings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because UFO sightings are dependent on firsthand reports, they
are subjective. What one individual perceives as another may recognize a
UFO as an everyday object or phenomenon.</p></li>
<li><p>The data does not consider the validity of the witnesses or the
circumstances surrounding the sightings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Reporting Bias:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reporting bias could exist if sightings are more common in
regions with greater interest in UFOs or where individuals are more
inclined to report such incidents.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of reports can increase or decrease depending on
public interest and media coverage, and these fluctuations may not
always correspond with real-world UFO activity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Geospatial Analysis Limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Geographic sightings may not conform to the spherical and
uniformly sized cluster assumptions made by the k-means clustering
algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>Mountain ranges, bodies of water, and urban vs. rural areas are
geographic features that should be considered when using latitude and
longitude coordinates.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Temporal Factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The temporal distribution of sightings may need to be considered in
the analysis. For instance, if the data covers several decades, sighting
frequencies may vary over time due to population growth or advancements
in drones and other aircraft.</li>
</ul>
<p>External Influences:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data analysis does not consider external elements that can
affect the chance of witnessing odd phenomena, such as weather,
visibility, or celestial events.</li>
</ul>
<p>Selection of Clusters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of clusters in k-means is a somewhat arbitrary decision
that can significantly impact the outcomes. The elbow technique, for
example, may yield a partial answer for determining the ideal number of
clusters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lack of Contextural Data:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is difficult to make firm judgments regarding the type or cause
of the sightings without more contextual information (such as the
location of nearby airports or military installations).</li>
</ul>
<p>Technological Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technological advancements may impact the quantity and nature of
reported UFO sightings. The quantity and kind of UFO sightings can be
influenced by technological advancements over time. For instance, the
number of unexplained objects in the sky has increased due to the
widespread use of drones.</li>
</ul>

<div id="final-thoughts" class="section level2">
<h2>Final Thoughts:</h2>
<p>We have delved deeply into the intriguing subject of UFO encounters
in the United States thanks to this study. After going over a large
amount of data, we’ve found some intriguing trends about the locations
and times that these enigmatic occurrences are most likely to be
recorded.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate that there are certain locations where UFO
sightings occur and that the details of these encounters might differ
significantly. We also observed that the quantity of sightings that have
been reported has varied over time, showing an unexpected increase
recently. We’re interested in learning more about the possible causes of
the patterns that appear to be more active in particular years and
locations.</p>
<p>We recognize that there are some limitations to our study. UFO
sightings are difficult to define since they are erratic and dependent
on eyewitness reports, which are not always reliable. Also, the use of
social media and technology has significantly altered how we gather and
disseminate information about these encounters.</p>
<p>After everything is said and done, we’re left curious. A mystery that
captivates our curiosity even after all the evidence we’ve examined
about UFO sightings is still present. We still don’t know enough about
this subject, which is what makes it so fascinating. We hope that our
work raises more issues and encourages more research down the road.</p>
