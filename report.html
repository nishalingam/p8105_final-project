<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Our project explores the reporting of unidentified flying objects
(UFOs) throughout the U.S. UFOs, by their very nature, leave unanswered
questions, some of which we hoped to explore through this project. With
the wealth of information gathered about these phenomena and motivated
by the <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/26/politics/ufo-house-hearing-congress/index.html">congressional
hearings</a> <a
href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/analysis-whistleblower-testimonies-did-not-change-our-basic-understanding-of-ufos">earlier
this year</a>, we wanted to create a resource to understand the data on
UFO encounters. Our project addresses three key components to provide
this understanding: when the encounters happened, where the encounters
happened, and what was encountered.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level3">
<h3>Related Work</h3>
<p>Inspired by the <a href="https://nuforc.org/">National UFO Reporting
Center</a>, research such as <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-01746-3">Faculty
perceptions of unidentified aerial phenomena</a>, <a
href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S2251171723400068">The
Scientific Investigation of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) Using
Multimodal Ground-Based Observatories</a>, our project seeks to expand
on existing research using advanced statistical methods and R
programming.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Initial Questions</h3>
<p>We started with basic questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the hotspots for UFO sightings?</li>
<li>What are the common characteristics of UFO sightings?</li>
<li>How have reports of UFO sightings changed over time?</li>
<li>Are there common features in these reports that can be
quantitatively analyzed?</li>
</ul>
<p>As our project progressed, we explored more nuanced questions.</p>
</div>
<div id="evolution-of-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Evolution of Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do certain geographical areas have higher frequencies of certain
types of UFO sightings?</li>
<li>Has the nature of UFO sightings changed over time? For example, a
follow-up to temporal pattern analysis looks at changes in
characteristics (shapes) of sightings across different decades.</li>
<li>Are there correlations between UFO sightings and other
variables?</li>
<li>Will mentioning certain words in the report affect the duration of
sightings or other variables?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level3">
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Our primary work was on data collected by the National UFO Reporting
Center (NUFORC). <a href="https://data.world/timothyrenner">Timothy
Renner</a> pulled and hosted the data version we used separately. We
restricted our analysis to UFO reports made within the U.S.A. and
removed reports that contained inconsistent locations (some reported
U.S. but showed longitudes and latitudes in South America, Europe, or
Canada) or were missing fundamental values. This left us with 100,820
reports from an initial set of 141,261 reports.</p>
<p>The duration of the UFO encounter was reported in the text and had
inconsistent formatting, as well as unexpected special characters, e.g.,
“~8 minutes,” “30 SECS,” or “3 hours or more.”. We wrote a function to
identify numeric time values within these strings and the appropriate
time units (seconds, minutes, and hours) and convert these reports to
numbers of seconds. While this approach wasn’t perfect, it allowed us to
perform subsequent analyses on most of the data. We incorporated data
from a few additional sources as well. To locate cities that were near
the location of UFO reports, we utilized a U.S. city dataset from <a
href="https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities">simple maps</a>. We used
decennial census data from the <a
href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/">U.S.
Census Bureau</a> to control for differing populations across states. We
also incorporated basic information about U.S. geography from R and the
<a href="https://geojson.org/">GeoJSON dataset</a>.</p>
<p>We also created new variables using packages such as
<code>stringr</code> and <code>spacyr</code>. The <code>spacyr</code>
package helps to dissect long comments into words. These words are
automatically processed into their root word, or lemma, and are tagged
by their parts of speech. Due to the size of the dataset, only 5000
random samples are used in the dataset. We created two other variables:
color, which extracts the first appearance of color given by the report,
and adj, which records the appearance of the top 20 adjectives in the
comments in binary form. The color analysis uses keywords generated from
R’s built-in function <code>colors()</code>, and the adjective analysis
uses keywords by filtering the top 20 from the <code>spacyr</code> data
frame.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Exploratory Analysis</h3>
<p>Our exploratory analysis included the following:</p>
<div id="trends-over-space" class="section level4">
<h4>Trends over space</h4>
<p>We began with an exploration of the distribution of UFO sightings,
first throughout the U.S. and then by distance to large cities. The
initial plotting of UFO sightings revealed three geographic hotspots:
the Pacific Northwest, Northern New England, and the Arizona-New Mexico
region.</p>
<p><img src="trend_space_files/figure-html/us%20heatmap-1.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Then, as we compared sightings made in a rural area with those made
in a rural one, we began to see differences between these groups.
Encounters in rural areas were longer (p-value: 3.39e-10), and had
differing characteristics than those in urban/suburban areas (p-value:
3.08e-7). These differences were explored further in a comprehensive
textual analysis of the reports.</p>

</div>
<div id="trend-and-adjusted-trend-over-years-by-states"
class="section level4">
<h4>Trend and Adjusted Trend Over Years by States</h4>
<p><img src="trend_time_files/figure-html/Trend%20over%20year%20by%20states-1.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Following 1995, there was a significant increase in UFO sightings,
possibly due to the internet’s quick development. Most states saw a peak
in sightings around 2014, then a decline. Nearly all states experienced
sharp declines in sightings in 2018, and then there was an increase in
2019 and 2020. UFO sightings within individual states varied
significantly from year to year, with some states showing sharp
increases or decreases. The number of UFO reports in California
consistently outnumbered those in other states, possibly due to
population effects.</p>
<p><img src="trend_time_files/figure-html/Trend%20per%20over%20year%20by%20states-1.png" class="center"></p>
<p>After adjusting for population, the overall trend mirrored the
aggregate sighting trend, with a rapid increase post-1995 and a peak
around 2014. Vermont consistently had the highest sightings per 1
million population, indicating a potential hotspot.</p>
</div>
<div id="trend-and-adjusted-trend-over-months-by-states"
class="section level4">
<h4>Trend and Adjusted Trend Over Months by States</h4>
<p><img src="trend_time_files/figure-html/Trend%20over%20months%20by%20states-1.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Sightings showed seasonal variations, with summer having the highest
reported sightings in most states. Some states, such as Florida,
experienced peak sightings in December, indicating regional variations.
Washington State showed a unique rapid increase starting in May and a
sharp decrease after July.</p>
<p><img src="trend_time_files/figure-html/Trend%20per%20over%20month%20by%20states%20-1.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Adjusting for population had a minimal impact on the trend over the
past few months. However, Alaska showed a unique trend with the highest
sightings per 1 million in winter, potentially related to polar
night.</p>
</div>
<div id="trend-over-hours-by-states" class="section level4">
<h4>Trend Over Hours by States</h4>
<p><img src="trend_time_files/figure-html/Trend%20over%20hours%20by%20states%20-1.png" class="center"></p>
<p>UFO sightings were more commonly reported during the evening hours,
peaking around 21:00. Sightings during daytime hours, particularly from
6:00 to 15:00, were relatively low.</p>
</div>
<div id="trend-over-weekdays-by-states" class="section level4">
<h4>Trend Over Weekdays by States</h4>
<p><img src="trend_time_files/figure-html/Trend%20over%20weekdays%20by%20states-1.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The average sightings increased gradually from Monday to Saturday,
peaking on Saturday, then decreasing on Sunday. California showed a
decline from Sunday to Monday, with an increase during the weekdays and
a peak on Saturday.</p>
</div>
<div id="trend-over-time-by-ufo-shapes" class="section level4">
<h4>Trend Over Time by UFO Shapes</h4>
<p><img src="trend_time_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Light, circles, and triangles were the most observed UFO shapes,
following a similar trend of rapid increase, peaking around 2014,
decline in 2018, and another peak in 2020. Fireball had a peak before
2000, while disk sightings showed a steady increase in the 1970s.</p>
</div>
<div id="adjectives-used-in-the-report-before-and-after-2000"
class="section level4">
<h4>Adjectives Used in the Report Before and After 2000:</h4>
<p>Adjectives used before 2000 exhibit greater diversity and complexity,
featuring descriptors like “approximate,” “entire,” “exact,” “round,”
“huge,” and “slow.” In contrast, post-2000 adjectives tend to be brief,
including terms such as “clear,” “slow,” and “big.” The prevalence of
contemporary words like “anonymous” in post-2000 data may be attributed
to the surge in UFO reports with the rise of internet usage. The
difference in average education levels between those reporting before
and after 2000, as well as the recent increase in photographic
information availability, may also have an impact on this shift.
Additionally, post-2000 messages tend to be more concise and direct,
possibly to expedite information dissemination.</p>

<h3>Text Analysis</h3>
<p><strong>Top Nouns:</strong> These words primarily identify elements
related to UFO sightings. They encompass the UFO itself (light, object),
the setting (sky, night, minute, second), and items used to distinguish
UFOs from conventional objects (star, plane, craft).</p>
<p><strong>Top Verbs:</strong> These verbs describe the actions and
reactions of both observers and the UFO. They encapsulate observations
(see, look, watch), movement (move, fly), and perceptions (appear,
disappear).</p>
<p><strong>Top Adjectives:</strong> These words are descriptive but
don’t fall strictly into noun or verb categories. They are being
analyzed for potential correlations with UFO sighting duration. They
include descriptors like brightness (bright, high, large), colors (red,
white, blue, orange, green, dark), quantity (few, many), clarity (clear,
visible), and peculiarity (strange, different).</p>

<h4>Correlation &amp; Regression Analysis</h4>
<p><strong>Color vs Rural/Urban</strong> To ascertain any potential
relationship between color and location, we conducted a Chi-Square Test,
yielding a significant p-value of 2.39e-09. As the location variable is
binary, we proceeded to perform a logistic regression analysis between
the variables. Through this analysis, we uncovered that gray and black
colors exert a positive influence on the likelihood of sightings in
rural locations, potentially due to their alignment with rural
surroundings. Conversely, colors frequently mentioned, such as white,
red, and yellow, demonstrate minimal impact in distinguishing between
rural and urban settings.</p>
<p><strong>Color vs Duration</strong> The dependent variable, duration,
is continuous, prompting us to apply a Box-Cox transformation for
normalization. After this transformation, we used the logarithm of
duration as the final dependent variable. By ANOVA analysis, we observed
that color frequency may impact the relationship between color and
duration. To address this, we standardized colors based on their overall
frequency. Subsequently, we conducted a comprehensive linear regression
analysis between duration and color, employing stepwise backward
regression based on AIC.</p>
<p>Both the full regression and the backward elimination regression
models revealed an R-squared value of 0.042, indicating a markedly weak
correlation. Notably, the estimates suggest that colors like green and
gray significantly reduce the duration of sightings, while the color
red, conversely, increases the duration of observations.”</p>
<p><strong>Color vs Shape</strong></p>
<p><img src="text_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" class="center"></p>
<p>We constructed a heatmap/correlation matrix to examine the
relationship between all color variables and shape variables. This
matrix was adjusted by the frequency of each color. The matrix is
re-weighted by the frequency of the color. Less common colors like
honeydew (disk), magenta (light), and khaki (egg) demonstrate a stronger
correlation with specific shapes compared to other colors. There is also
a high correlation with common combinations such as white light, white
fireball, etc.. Conversely, rare combinations such as gray fireball,
gray flash, brown light, etc., exhibit a lower correlation.</p>
<p><strong>Color vs Time of Day</strong> After plotting the two
variables, it appears that the scores are uniformly distributed,
indicating no discernible relationship between color and time of
day.</p>
<p><strong>Adjective vs. Duration</strong></p>
<p><img src="text_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png" class="center"></p>
<p>We conducted a series of analyses including linear regression, ANOVA
for result assessment, followed by cross-validation-based linear
regression, and LASSO regression. Using the coefficients we get from the
LASSO regression, we discovered the following: Shorter duration
sightings tend to report general (clear, significant, high) and evident
words with less vivid colors (dark, green). In contrast, longer-duration
sightings tend to report detailed (first, second, close, bright), less
obvious (strange, small), and easily noticeable colors (orange, red,
white, blue).</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>Our initial goal was to identify times and places where UFO reports
were common. According to the data, sightings occur less frequently in
remote locations than crowded urban areas. This implies that the more
possible observers there are, the more likely it is that sighting
reports will occur. But it also suggests that some geographical
characteristics or other unidentified factors can contribute to the
frequency of UFO encounters. Regarding the typical features of UFO
reports, our research showed various observed forms and actions. But
reports of “lights,” “circles,” and “discs” were standard, and they fit
with the traditional UFO imagery that has been widely accepted in the
media and popular culture.</p>
<p>When exploring how reports of UFO sightings have changed over time,
we conducted a temporal analysis that showed a noticeable increase in
reported sightings during the late 20th century, which could be
correlated with the rise in science fiction media during that time.
According to our analysis, the majority of states saw a surge in UFO
encounters around 2014. There are multiple possible explanations for
this peak. Increased public interest in significant celestial events,
the availability of more digital recording equipment, and the widespread
use of drones may have led to more sightings and reports. Social media’s
ability to spread information quickly contributed to this increase as
well since sites like Facebook and Twitter have grown widely used and
made it possible for sightings to be reported promptly.</p>
<p>What’s interesting about 2018 is how few sightings there were. It
also corresponds with when drone technology became much more accessible
to the general public. This may have contributed to initial bewilderment
but ultimately improved public awareness of these objects and reduced
the number of UFO reports. Furthermore, modifications to the reporting
and data collection regulations might have affected the quantity of
reported sightings. One possible explanation for this reduction could
have been a modification to the reporting guidelines of the National UFO
Reporting Center.</p>
<p>The upsurge of sightings in 2019 and 2020 may be attributed to
various environmental and socio-cultural variables. Global lockdowns
resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, which started at the end of 2019
and continued throughout 2020. People may have spent extra time at home
due to the lockdowns, taking a closer look at the sky and witnessing
things they might not have noticed. Additionally, the Pentagon’s UFO
movies may have sparked the public’s renewed interest in aerial
phenomena, which may have led to an increase in the number of sightings
reported.</p>
<p>Seasonal fluctuations with summer highs may be linked to greater
outside activities and brighter skies, which raises the possibility of
seeing strange events. Local events, weather patterns, or tourists may
have an impact on regional variances, such as Florida’s peak in
December. The distinct atmospheric conditions during the polar night may
be responsible for Alaska’s winter peak, increasing the visibility or
prevalence of certain aerial phenomena. A number of reasons could
account for the rise in reports in the evenings: more people are at home
to watch the sky, and lights in the sky become more visible as night
falls. The decreased number of sightings during the day may mean that
UFOs are less noticeable in the daylight or maybe because witnesses are
too busy during the day to detect or report strange objects.</p>
<p>The steady rise in sightings before Saturday may indicate that
people’s capacity and propensity to record sightings are influenced by
their free time. It’s possible that people were getting ready for the
upcoming workweek and spending less time gazing up at the sky on Sunday.
California’s distinct weekly pattern might be a reflection of social or
cultural norms peculiar to the state, such as weekly celebrations that
encourage individuals to gaze upward more frequently.</p>
<p>Most sightings were short—often lasting less than two
minutes—according to the recorded and categorized sighting durations,
which contribute to the quantitative aspects of the reports. This
numerical component gives the typically subjective nature of UFO
sighting accounts a veneer of objectivity.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the abundance of lights, triangles, and circles
represents common shapes of aerial vehicles or other objects that the
general public is unlikely to recognize. Additionally, these shapes are
frequently shown in media depictions of UFOs, which may sway people’s
accounts. The unusual trend of fireballs and disks may have been caused
by particular UFO events or by cultural factors prevalent at the time
that made certain shapes more “popular” or easily identifiable as
UFOs.</p>
<p>Pre-2000 reports were more descriptive in language. However, reports
written after 2000 were more concise. This difference in language use
may be attributed to the evolving nature of communication in the digital
age, where brevity is frequently rewarded for speedy information
transmission. The term “anonymous” appears in reports from after 2000,
which may point to a rise in people’s desire for anonymity or privacy in
the digital age. The change in terminology may also indicate shifts in
the demographics of those reporting sightings of UFOs, as descriptions
of sightings may differ depending on one’s educational background or
level of technological comfort.</p>
<p>Terminologies such as “clear,” “large,” and “high” in reports imply
that observers may accurately recognize certain traits even in
situations where the interaction is brief. These terms convey a degree
of confidence to the observer. Less striking hues like “dark” and
“green” may only be observed in a transient sighting and thus not be as
noticeable as others. The fact that observers have little time to
comprehend and remember what happened may be the reason for the vague
adjectives they employ; instead, they may choose to use more general
descriptors that are less precise but still capture the main ideas of
what they saw. The observer may have preferred to use more specific
terms like “first,” “second,” “close,” and “bright” since they had more
time to examine the object closely and pick up on more subtle aspects.
Upon closer examination, terms like “small” and “strange” may surface,
enabling a comparison of the UFO’s characteristics with those of the
surrounding area. Easy-to-identify colors like “orange,” “red,” “white,”
and “blue” are reported, which implies that prolonged sightings provide
witnesses with sufficient opportunity to see more vibrant colors that
they might otherwise miss during a brief encounter.</p>

<div id="limitations" class="section level3">
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>Despite the insights achieved by the project, there are several
limitations of note. The first is that we are limited by the quality of
the reports themselves. Not only is the reliability of UFO witnesses in
question, but the lack of a standardized reporting system means that the
way reports were made was highly variable. The subjectivity of the
encounter, and the requirement that the object observed be
‘unidentified’ further compounds this issue. We also do not know what
reports were not made and if a lack of reporting corresponds to a lack
of UFO sightings or simply an unwillingness to make that sighting
known.</p>
<p>Additionally, we wish to acknowledge some limitations in our methods.
We primarily worked with latitude and longitude data, which ignored
relevant geographic features such as mountain ranges, bodies of water,
and developed areas that might impact the probability of UFO sightings,
as well as the distribution. Of particular note in the UFO literature is
the impact of military bases on UFO report frequency. Additionally, we
made the urban/suburban vs. rural areas distinction based upon distance
to cities rather than the more precise metric of population density.
Further, we looked at reports over several decades but did not have the
data to control for technological changes across this timeframe, both
with respect to flying objects (i.e., drones) and the means of observing
them (i.e., camera improvements).</p>
<p>In our approach to the keyword detection process of the color
analysis, the data was approached with an aggressive matter. Only the
first color mentioned is extracted. The color could also identify the
surroundings or the location name, hence creating misleading results
from the findings. As advanced as the package Spacyr can be, there still
exist errors in identifying the parts of speech of the parsed words.
Misspelled words may not be identified by the algorithm.</p>

<div id="final-thoughts" class="section level3">
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Our project delves into the intriguing subject of UFO sightings. By
their very nature, these unidentified objects ask questions of the
observer. We have used a data-driven approach to explore trends in these
reports and open new avenues for inquiry.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate that UFO sightings are not uniform throughout
the U.S., nor do they perfectly correlate with population density. There
are certain locations where UFO sightings occur with higher frequency,
and the heterogeneity of these encounters asks even more questions of us
as data enthusiasts.</p>
<p>After everything is said and done, we’re left curious. A mystery that
captivates our curiosity even after all the evidence we’ve examined
about UFO sightings is still present. We still don’t know enough about
this subject, which is what makes it so fascinating. We hope that our
work raises more issues and encourages more research down the road.</p>
