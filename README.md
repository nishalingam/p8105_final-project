### Unraveling the Mysteries of the Skies
Our project explores the reporting of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) throughout the U.S. UFOs, by their very nature, leave unanswered questions, some of which we hope to explore through this project. With the wealth of information gathered about these phenomena and motivated by the [congressional hearings](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/26/politics/ufo-house-hearing-congress/index.html) [earlier this year](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/analysis-whistleblower-testimonies-did-not-change-our-basic-understanding-of-ufos), we wanted to create a resource to understand the data on UFO encounters. Our project addresses three key components to provide this understanding: *when* the encounters happened, *where* the encounters happened, and *what* was encountered.
