<p>In this page we will explore where UFO sightings are reported in the
United States. First we will visualize where throughout the U.S. these
reports are being made, and then compare reports made in urban/suburban
areas (i.e. close to major cities), and those made in rural areas
(i.e. far from major cities). We separate these two groups using a
cutoff criteria of being within 5 miles of a city with more than 200,000
residents.</p>

<p>If we cluster the number of observations by nearest large city, we
see a similar result. The two cities with the most UFO sightings nearby
are are Seattle, WA and Portland, OR. These are large cities but not the
largest in the U.S. The West Coast seems to have more reports than other
areas, though St. Louis is a bit of an outlier in this regard.</p>

<h2>Rural vs Urban Differences</h2>
<p>With this preliminary understanding of the geographic distribution of
UFO reports, we wanted to explore if the distance from large cities is
related to characteristics of the report. To do this, we separate
reports into <code>urban/suburban</code> and <code>rural</code>
categories, using a cutoff value of 5 miles to a large city. This is not
a perfect division, as this distinction should really be done by
population density, but should be servicable to identify major
differences, as will be seen below.</p>

<p>Both rural and urban reports look similar, with the same ranking of
the reported shapes. The most common descriptor of the UFO was just a
<code>light</code>, followed by either <code>circle</code> or
<code>triangle</code>. To analyze whether descriptions of UFOs varied
between these groups, we conducted a Chi-Squared test of homogeneity.
This revealed that the distribution of shapes did differ significantly
between the urban/suburban and rural categories.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_loc_shape |&gt; 
  select(-shape) |&gt; 
  as.matrix() |&gt;

## 
## data:  as.matrix(select(df_loc_shape, -shape))
## X-squared = 72.097, df = 22, p-value = 3.082e-07</code></pre>
<p>This result is not being influenced by the comparatively few
observations for some shapes. If the data set is restricted to only the
top 10 or top 15 shapes, the p-value is still far below 0.05.</p>

<div id="encounter-duration" class="section level3">
<h3>Encounter Duration</h3>
<p>Next, we wish to consider whether the length of UFO encounters is
different between the urban/suburban and rural groups. First, we will
look at the data, which skewed right (more observations on the second
scale than the minute scale, and more on the minute scale than the hour
scale). So to understand the distribution, we will look at the data on
the log scale.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_ufo |&gt; 
  drop_na(duration_clean) |&gt;

    breaks = scales::trans_breaks(&quot;log10&quot;, function(x) 10^x),
    labels = scales::trans_format(&quot;log10&quot;, scales::math_format(10^.x))
                     ) +
  labs(
    title = &quot;Distribution of encounter duration&quot;,
    y = &quot;Number of reports&quot;,

  )</code></pre>
<p><img src="trend_space_files/figure-html/log%20histogram%20duration-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>Even though the data are highly right-skewed, there are enough
observations that it is still valid to compare the data using a t-test.
There are 1266 reports with a duration over 2 hours, comprising about 1%
of the sample. These reports range from several hours to several months.
I will restrict the comparison of the data to those with encounters
lasting at most hours.</p>

<p>The results of this test suggest that there is a significant
difference between the average duration of the rural UFO sightings and
the urban UFO sightings. We estimate that sightings in rural areas last
for approximately one minute longer than sightings in urban areas (10.5
minutes vs. 9.5 minutes).</p>
