## Motivation

Our project explores the reporting of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) throughout the U.S. UFOs, by their very nature, leave unanswered questions, some of which we hope to explore through this project. With the wealth of information gathered about these phenomena and motivated by the [congressional hearings](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/26/politics/ufo-house-hearing-congress/index.html) [earlier this year](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/analysis-whistleblower-testimonies-did-not-change-our-basic-understanding-of-ufos), we wanted to create a resource to understand the data on UFO encounters. Our project addresses three key components to provide this understanding: when the encounters happened, where the encounters happened, and what was encountered.

## Related Work

Inspired by[National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/), researches such as [Faculty perceptions of unidentified aerial phenomena](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-01746-3), [The Scientific Investigation of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) Using Multimodal Ground-Based Observatories](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S2251171723400068), our project seeks to expand on existing research using advanced statistical methods and R programming.

## Initial Questions

We started with key questions like:

* What are the hotspots for UFO sightings?

* What are the common characteristics of UFO sightings?

* How have reports of UFO sightings changed over time?

* Are there common features in these reports that can be quantitatively analyzed?

As our project progressed, we began to explore more nuanced questions.

## Evolution of Questions:

* Do certain geographical areas have higher frequencies of certain types of UFO sightings?

* Has the nature of UFO sightings changed over time?  For example, a follow-up to temporal pattern analysis, looking at changes in characteristics (shapes) of sightings across different decades.

* Are there correlations between UFO sightings and other variables?

* Will mentioning certain words in the report affect the duration of sightings or other variables?


## Data

Our primary work was on data collected by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). [Timothy Renner](https://data.world/timothyrenner) pulled and hosted the data version we used separately. We restricted our analysis to UFO reports made within the U.S.A. and removed reports that contained inconsistent locations (some reported U.S. but showed longitudes and latitudes in South America, Europe, or Canada) or were missing fundamental values. This left us with 100,820 reports from an initial set of 141,261 reports.

The duration of the UFO encounter was reported in the text and had inconsistent formatting, as well as unexpected special characters, e.g., “~8 minutes," “30 SECS," or “3 hours or more.”. We wrote a function to identify numeric time values within these strings and the appropriate time units (seconds, minutes, and hours) and convert these reports to numbers of seconds. While this approach wasn’t perfect, it allowed us to perform subsequent analyses on most of the data.

We incorporated data from a few additional sources as well. To locate cities that were near the location of UFO reports, we utilized a U.S. city dataset from [simple maps](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities). We used decennial census data from the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/) to control for differing populations across states. We also incorporated basic information about U.S. geography from R and the [GeoJSON dataset](https://geojson.org/).

We also created new variables using packages such as stringr and spacyr. The spacyr package helps to dissect long comments into words. These words are automatically processed into their root word, or lemma, and are tagged by their parts of speech. Due to the size of the dataset, only 5000 random samples are used in the dataset. We created two other variables: color, which extracts the first appearance of color given by the report, and adj, which records the appearance of the top 20 adjectives in the comments in binary form. The color analysis uses keywords generated from R's built-in function color(), and the adjective analysis uses keywords by filtering the top 20 from the spacyr data frame.

## Exploratory Analysis

Our exploratory analysis included the following:

1.	Initial Data Summarization: 


Descriptive statistics: Calculate basic statistics like the number of sightings, average duration, and distributions of sightings over time. 



Examples include:

* Number of sightings: There are 100,802 reported UFO sightings in the dataset.

* The average duration of sightings: The average duration of these sightings is approximately 451819 seconds. Notice that this high average might be influenced by the dataset's high duration values, suggesting the need for further investigation and analyses.

*	Distributions of sightings over time: The distribution of sightings by year starts from 1969 and shows a consistent number each year. For the first few years, the counts are as follows:

**	1969: 8760 sightings
**	1970: 8760 sightings
**	1971: 8760 sightings
**	1972: 8764 sightings
**	1973: 8760 sightings

* Color frequency: The most common colors are those associated with higher wavelengths, such as white, red, and orange, with blue and green coming in second and third, respectively. On the other hand, less frequently observed colors in both UFO sightings and regular lights, such as pink, purple, brown, grey, and yellow, occupy the lower spectrum.

2.	Geographical Analysis:

* Create heat maps to show the geographical distributions of sightings.

* Create an interactive map that includes the color mentioned in the report and the shape of the UFO.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Create Heat Maps
ggplot(ufo, aes(x = city_longitude, y = city_latitude)) +
  geom_bin2d(bins = 100) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  labs(title = "Heat Map of UFO Sightings", 
       x = "Longitude", 
       y = "Latitude")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Create Interactive Map
leaflet(ufo) |>
  addTiles() |>
  addHeatmap(lng = ~city_longitude,
             lat = ~city_latitude,
             intensity = -1, 
             radius = 15,
             blur = 20)
```



3.	Temporal Analysis:

The frequency of sightings over time (years, months, hours of the day, weekdays) is of main concern in temporal analysis. We mainly use line charts to visualize the aggregate trends of each state over time and then use smooth lines to estimate the average sighting trend in the US. 

**Trend and Adjusted Trend Over Years by States: **
<img src="trend_time_files/figure-html/Trend over hours by states -1.png" style="width:75%">
Following 1995, there was a significant increase in UFO sightings, possibly due to the internet's quick development. Most states saw a peak in sightings around 2014, then a decline. Nearly all states experienced sharp declines in sightings in 2018, and then there was an increase in 2019 and 2020. UFO sightings within individual states varied significantly from year to year, with some states showing sharp increases or decreases.  The number of UFO reports in California consistently outnumbered those in other states, possibly due to population effects.

After adjusting for population, the overall trend mirrored the aggregate sighting trend, with a rapid increase post-1995 and a peak around 2014. Vermont consistently had the highest sightings per 1 million population, indicating a potential hotspot.

**Trend and Adjusted Trend Over Months by States: **
Sightings showed seasonal variations, with summer having the highest reported sightings in most states. Some states, such as Florida, experienced peak sightings in December, indicating regional variations. Washington State showed a unique rapid increase starting in May and a sharp decrease after July.

Adjusting for population had a minimal impact on the trend over the past few months. However, Alaska showed a unique trend with the highest sightings per 1 million in winter, potentially related to polar night.

**Trend Over Hours by States: **
UFO sightings were more commonly reported during the evening hours, peaking around 21:00. Sightings during daytime hours, particularly from 6:00 to 15:00, were relatively low.

**Trend Over Weekdays by States:**
The average sightings increased gradually from Monday to Saturday, peaking on Saturday, then decreasing on Sunday.  California showed a decline from Sunday to Monday, with an increase during the weekdays and a peak on Saturday.

**Trend Over Time by UFO Shapes:**
Light, circles, and triangles were the most observed UFO shapes, following a similar trend of rapid increase, peaking around 2014, decline in 2018, and another peak in 2020. Fireball had a peak before 2000, while disk sightings showed a steady increase in the 1970s.

**Adjectives Used in The Report Before and After 2000:**
Adjectives used before 2000 exhibit greater diversity and complexity, featuring descriptors like "approximate," "entire," "exact," "round," "huge," and "slow." In contrast, post-2000 adjectives tend to be brief, including terms such as "clear," "slow," and "big." The prevalence of contemporary words like "anonymous" in post-2000 data may be attributed to the surge in UFO reports with the rise of internet usage. The difference in average education levels between those reporting before and after 2000, as well as the recent increase in photographic information availability, may also have an impact on this shift. Additionally, post-2000 messages tend to be more concise and direct, possibly to expedite information dissemination.




4.	Categorical Analysis:
Bar Charts and Pie Charts: Examine the distribution of sightings by categories like shape of the object, duration, and text.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Bar Chart for Shape
ufo |>
  count(shape) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = shape, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", 
           fill = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of UFO Sightings by Shape",
       x = "Shape",
       y = "Number of Sightins") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Pie Chart for Shape
shape_counts = ufo |>
  count(shape) 

pie(shape_counts$n,
    labels = shape_counts$shape,
    main = "Proportion of UFO Sightings by Shape", 
    col = rainbow(nrow(shape_counts)))
  
```

From the bar chart and pie chart for shape, we could notice one category that stands out with a significantly higher number of sightings than the others, which is "light.”. This indicates that rather than solid objects with distinct shapes, people are likelier to claim encounters with mysterious lights when they report UFOs. It’s also important to understand that “UFO” refers to any flying object the viewer cannot identify. It doesn’t always indicate that it originated from another planet.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Histogram for Duration
ufo |>
  ggplot(aes(x = duration_clean)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10,
                 fill = "blue",
                 color = "black") +
  labs(title = "HIstogram of UFO Sightings by Duration",
       x = "Duration",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Because the `duration `is very skewed and has a wide range in the histogram, we change it to categorize the durations into intervals and then plot a bar chart.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Bar Chart for Duration
ufo = ufo |>
  mutate(duration_category = cut(duration_clean, 
                                 breaks = c(0, 30, 60, 120, 300, 600, Inf),
                                 labels = c("0-30", "30-60", "60-120", "120-300", "300-600", "600+"),
                                 right = FALSE))

ufo |>
  count(duration_category) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = duration_category, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Bar Chart of UFO Sightings by Duration Cattegories",
       x = "Duration Category",
       y = "Number of Sightings") +
  theme_minimal()
  
```

**Short Duration Sightings (0–30 seconds):** While casual viewers are likely to notice something strange for a brief amount of time, this group has a large frequency of sightings, which is typical.

**The medium-duration sighting categories (60–120 and 120–300 seconds):** exhibit a lower number of sightings compared to the shortest-duration category. This could indicate that fewer UFOs are viewed for these prolonged periods of time or that witnesses are less inclined to remain or report longer observations.

**Long-Duration Sightings (300–600 seconds):** It's interesting to note that a notable rise has been observed in sightings that extend from five to ten minutes. There are several possible explanations for this, including the UFO's stable position, several observations recorded as a single event or longer-lasting celestial phenomena misidentified as UFOs.

**Very Long Duration Sightings (600+ seconds):** This category also contains a high number of reports of sightings, some of which may be observations of events that are reported over an extended period of time or that linger all night.






5.	Correlation Analysis:

Statistical Tests: Conduct correlation analysis between variables like time of day, shape, duration, city_latitude, city_longitude, and sightings detail.

6. Text Analysis

**Top Nouns:** These words primarily identify elements related to UFO sightings. They encompass the UFO itself (light, object), the setting (sky, night, minute, second), and items used to distinguish UFOs from conventional objects (star, plane, craft).

**Top Verbs:** These verbs describe the actions and reactions of both observers and the UFO. They encapsulate observations (see, look, watch), movement (move, fly), and perceptions (appear, disappear).

**Top Adjectives:** These words are descriptive but don’t fall strictly into noun or verb categories. They are being analyzed for potential correlations with UFO sighting duration. They include descriptors like brightness (bright, high, large), colors (red, white, blue, orange, green, dark), quantity (few, many), clarity (clear, visible), and peculiarity (strange, different).


7. Regression Analysis:
Shorter duration sightings tend to report general (clear, large, high) and evident words with less vivid colors (dark, green), whereas longer duration sightings tend to report detailed (first, second, close, bright), less obvious (strange, small), and easily noticeable colors (orange, red, white, blue).

## Discussion

**Findings:**

The goal of our initial question was to locate UFO sighting hotspots. By using k-means clustering analysis, we were able to determine that sightings are more common in particularly isolated locales as well as heavily populated urban areas. This implies that while the probability of sighting reports rises with the number of possible witnesses, specific topographical characteristics or other unidentified factors can influence the locations of UFO sightings.

Regarding the typical features of UFO reports, our research showed various observed forms and actions. But reports of "lights," "circles," and "discs" were standard, and they fit with the traditional UFO imagery that has been widely accepted in the media and popular culture.  

When exploring how reports of UFO sightings have changed over time, we conducted a temporal analysis that showed a noticeable increase in reported sightings during the late 20th century, which could be correlated with the rise in science fiction media during that time. 

According to our analysis, the majority of states saw a surge in UFO encounters around 2014. There are multiple possible explanations for this peak. Increased public interest in significant celestial events, the availability of more digital recording equipment, and the widespread use of drones may have led to more sightings and reports. Social media's ability to spread information quickly contributed to this increase as well since sites like Facebook and Twitter have grown widely used and made it possible for sightings to be reported promptly. 

What's interesting about 2018 is how few sightings there were. It also corresponds with when drone technology became much more accessible to the general public. This may have contributed to initial bewilderment but ultimately improved public awareness of these objects and reduced the number of UFO reports. Furthermore, modifications to the reporting and data collection regulations might have affected the quantity of reported sightings. One possible explanation for this reduction could have been a modification to the reporting guidelines of the National UFO Reporting Center.

The upsurge of sightings in 2019 and 2020 may be attributed to various environmental and socio-cultural variables. Global lockdowns resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, which started at the end of 2019 and continued throughout 2020. People may have spent extra time at home due to the lockdowns, taking a closer look at the sky and witnessing things they might not have noticed. Additionally, the Pentagon's UFO movies may have sparked the public's renewed interest in aerial phenomena, which may have led to an increase in the number of sightings reported.

Seasonal fluctuations with summer highs may be linked to greater outside activities and brighter skies, which raises the possibility of seeing strange events. Local events, weather patterns, or tourists may have an impact on regional variances, such as Florida's peak in December. The distinct atmospheric conditions during the polar night may be responsible for Alaska's winter peak, increasing the visibility or prevalence of certain aerial phenomena.

A number of reasons could account for the rise in reports in the evenings: more people are at home to watch the sky, lights in the sky become more visible as night falls, and the usage of recreational drugs during these hours may affect people's propensity to report sightings. The decreased number of sightings during the day may mean that UFOs are less noticeable in the daylight or maybe because witnesses are too busy during the day to detect or report strange objects.

The steady rise in sightings before Saturday may indicate that people's capacity and propensity to record sightings are influenced by their free time. It's possible that people were getting ready for the upcoming workweek and spending less time gazing up at the sky on Sunday. California's distinct weekly pattern might be a reflection of social or cultural norms peculiar to the state, such as weekly celebrations that encourage individuals to gaze upward more frequently.

Most sightings were short—often lasting less than two minutes—according to the recorded and categorized sighting durations, which contribute to the quantitative aspects of the reports. This numerical component gives the typically subjective nature of UFO sighting accounts a veneer of objectivity.

It's possible that the abundance of lights, triangles, and circles represents common shapes of aerial vehicles or other objects that the general public is unlikely to recognize. Additionally, these shapes are frequently shown in media depictions of UFOs, which may sway people's accounts. The unusual trend of fireballs and disks may have been caused by particular UFO events or by cultural factors prevalent at the time that made certain shapes more "popular" or easily identifiable as UFOs.

Pre-2000 reports were more descriptive in language. However, reports written after 2000 were more concise. This difference in language use may be attributed to the evolving nature of communication in the digital age, where brevity is frequently rewarded for speedy information transmission. The term "anonymous" appears in reports from after 2000, which may point to a rise in people's desire for anonymity or privacy in the digital age. The change in terminology may also indicate shifts in the demographics of those reporting sightings of UFOs, as descriptions of sightings may differ depending on one's educational background or level of technological comfort.

Terminologies such as "clear," "large," and "high" in reports imply that observers may accurately recognize certain traits even in situations where the interaction is brief. These terms convey a degree of confidence to the observer. Less striking hues like "dark" and "green" may only be observed in a transient sighting and thus not be as noticeable as others. The fact that observers have little time to comprehend and remember what happened may be the reason for the vague adjectives they employ; instead, they may choose to use more general descriptors that are less precise but still capture the main ideas of what they saw.

The observer may have preferred to use more specific terms like "first," "second," "close," and "bright" since they had more time to examine the object closely and pick up on more subtle aspects. Upon closer examination, terms like "small" and "strange" may surface, enabling a comparison of the UFO's characteristics with those of the surrounding area. Easy-to-identify colors like "orange," "red," "white," and "blue" are reported, which implies that prolonged sightings provide witnesses with sufficient opportunity to see more vibrant colors that they might otherwise miss during a brief encounter.

## Limitations:

Data Quality and Completeness:

*	The statistics on UFO sightings can be improved by complete reporting. It's possible that witnesses won't report every sighting or that their descriptions need to be revised.

*	The analysis may be skewed by errors in the reported data, such as misspelled dates, times, places, or durations.

Subjectivity in Sightings:

*	Because UFO sightings are dependent on firsthand reports, they are subjective. What one individual perceives as another may recognize a UFO as an everyday object or phenomenon.

*	The data does not consider the validity of the witnesses or the circumstances surrounding the sightings.

Reporting Bias:

*	Reporting bias could exist if sightings are more common in regions with greater interest in UFOs or where individuals are more inclined to report such incidents.

* The number of reports can increase or decrease depending on public interest and media coverage, and these fluctuations may not always correspond with real-world UFO activity.

Geospatial Analysis Limitations:

*	Geographic sightings may not conform to the spherical and uniformly sized cluster assumptions made by the k-means clustering algorithm.

* Mountain ranges, bodies of water, and urban vs. rural areas are geographic features that should be considered when using latitude and longitude coordinates.

Temporal Factors:

*	The temporal distribution of sightings may need to be considered in the analysis. For instance, if the data covers several decades, sighting frequencies may vary over time due to population growth or advancements in drones and other aircraft.

External Influences:

*	The data analysis does not consider external elements that can affect the chance of witnessing odd phenomena, such as weather, visibility, or celestial events.

Selection of Clusters:

*	The number of clusters in k-means is a somewhat arbitrary decision that can significantly impact the outcomes. The elbow technique, for example, may yield a partial answer for determining the ideal number of clusters.

Lack of Contextural Data:

*	It is difficult to make firm judgments regarding the type or cause of the sightings without more contextual information (such as the location of nearby airports or military installations).

Technological Changes:

*	Technological advancements may impact the quantity and nature of reported UFO sightings. The quantity and kind of UFO sightings can be influenced by technological advancements over time. For instance, the number of unexplained objects in the sky has increased due to the widespread use of drones.

## Final Thoughts:

We have delved deeply into the intriguing subject of UFO encounters in the United States thanks to this study. After going over a large amount of data, we’ve found some intriguing trends about the locations and times that these enigmatic occurrences are most likely to be recorded.

Our results demonstrate that there are certain locations where UFO sightings occur and that the details of these encounters might differ significantly. We also observed that the quantity of sightings that have been reported has varied over time, showing an unexpected increase recently. We’re interested in learning more about the possible causes of the patterns that appear to be more active in particular years and locations.

We recognize that there are some limitations to our study. UFO sightings are difficult to define since they are erratic and dependent on eyewitness reports, which are not always reliable. Also, the use of social media and technology has significantly altered how we gather and disseminate information about these encounters.

After everything is said and done, we’re left curious. A mystery that captivates our curiosity even after all the evidence we’ve examined about UFO sightings is still present. We still don’t know enough about this subject, which is what makes it so fascinating. We hope that our work raises more issues and encourages more research down the road.
