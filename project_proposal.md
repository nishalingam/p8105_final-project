### Project Title (tentative)

Aliens Among U.S.: Visualizing UFO Sightings Across the United States

### Project Motivation

We are interested in the patterns in reported UFO sightings throughout
the U.S.A.. We aim to visualize the trends in UFO reports over space
(what regions across the U.S.) and time (years).

### Final Products

We will create a website that contains a map depicting the geographical
distribution of UFO sightings across the country over time. We may
create a Shiny app to provide users with custom information of UFO
sightings. We will also submit our group GitHub repository and
screencast video presenting the contents of our website.

### Anticipated data sources

We plan to pull data directly from the National UFO Reporting Center
(NUFORC), which serves as a database for both government and civilian
use. If we are unable to pull data directly from the NUFORC site, we
will use subsets of the NUFORC data set that have been publicly hosted
on platforms such as GitHub and Kaggle.

- National UFO Reporting Center <https://nuforc.org/>
- Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings/>
- GitHub - <https://github.com/timothyrenner/nuforc_sightings_data>

### Planned analyses/visualizations/coding challenges

We plan to create an interactive plot of reported UFO sightings across
the U.S., and depict how these reports change with time. Challenges will
likely come from tidying the dataset, such as standardizing the reports
of UFO sightings (e.g. duration of encounter is reported in either
seconds, minutes, hours, or a raw time), and handling misisng data.

We will also attempt a keyword extraction from comments Tidying
datasets, such as city (e.g. “epsom (surrey) (uk/england)”, “new york
city (brooklyn)”, “eslö&#44 scania (sweden)”) or profession.
